Objectives

In this this PyCitySchools scenario,  I am assuming that I am  the Chief Data Scientist for my local government area. I am tasked with helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. I have been provided with access to every studentâ€™s maths and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. I aggregated the data to showcase the following trends in school performance:

o Local Government Area Summary o School Summary o Highest Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing) o Lowest Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing) o Maths Scores by Grade o Reading Scores by Grade o Scores by School Spending o Scores by School Size o Scores by School Type

Observations Based Upon Findings

# Analysis:
1. Refer to the Scores by School Spending, the output table shows that the schools spending less budget on each student seem to have better performance than schools spending more budget on each student.

2. Refer to the Scores by School Size, the  output table shows that there is a significance school's perfomrance differences between schools having less than 2,000 students and more than 2,000 students which implies that the bigger school size tend to have lower perfomance.

3. Based on School Type, Independent Schools tend to have better performance than Government Schools.
